The directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of variadic functions in C programming. The projects in this directory showcase the implementation of variadic functions using the <stdarg.h> header, which provides a way to access the variable arguments passed to the function. These projects offer practical examples of variadic functions and demonstrate how they can be utilized to work with an arbitrary number of arguments in C programming.

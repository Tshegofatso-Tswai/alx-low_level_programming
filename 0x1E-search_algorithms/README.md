# 0x1E Search Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various search algorithms in C. I covered different search algorithms implemented in the C programming language. Search algorithms are essential techniques for finding the presence of an element or value in a collection of data. Within the implementations here learned to demonstrate the workings of these algorithms with different data structures.

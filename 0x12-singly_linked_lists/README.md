Contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists. These programs showcase how to create a singly linked list, add elements to the list, print the elements of the list, find the number of nodes, and free the allocated memory for the list. Each program is designed to teach the fundamentals of singly linked lists in C, providing a solid foundation for understanding and working with linked data structures in programming. The repository also includes a header file lists.h defining the necessary data structures and function prototypes for working with singly linked lists.

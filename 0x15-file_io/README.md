This directory contains C programs that demonstrate various file I/O operations. These programs showcase interactions with files using system calls like open, read, write, and close, as well as library functions such as fopen, fread, fwrite, and fclose. I have covered reading and writing to files, copying file contents, and manipulating file permissions. These exercises provide a practical understanding of file handling and I/O operations in C programming.
